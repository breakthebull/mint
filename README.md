## ☕ Triple-Layer Accent System

Mocha Latte Cafe 003 features a unique **triple-layer accent system** that gives you unprecedented control:

### How It Works:

1. **🌿 Accent Presets** (Forest Mint, Midnight Blue, Burgundy, Earthy Gold)  
   *The base roast* - Sets the overall color mood of your theme

2. **🌿 Primary Accent Color** (in Style Settings)  
   *The espresso shot* - Controls borders, links, and interactive elements

3. **🌿 Native Obsidian Accent** (in Appearance settings)  
   *The cream* - Affects hover states and subtle interactive elements

### Why It's Awesome:

> *"It's like having a barista craft your perfect coffee - you get to layer flavors that work together to create something uniquely yours."*

This system lets you:
- Create **rich, multi-dimensional color schemes** where accents complement rather than conflict
- Use the **Forest Mint preset** as your base, then add **custom accents** for striking contrast
- Maintain **consistent hover states** while customizing your primary accent
- Achieve **professional-level design** without needing CSS knowledge
